/*
  Problem Specification:
 *Pass appData structure to a thread and use variable a and b 100 times whenever a is set to 5.
 *Use a local "uses" variable to count 100 of our uses.
 *Increment application's useCount in case someone else want to keep track of how many times
  our data has been used
 *Add a small usleep to make sure the scheduler gives the other threads a chance to run.
